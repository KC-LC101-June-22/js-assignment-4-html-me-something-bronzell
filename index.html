      <b> <div id = "Name"></div>Nagato AKA Pain Info:</b>
      Nagato was a shinobi of Amegakure and descendant of the Uzumaki clan. Forming Akatsuki alongside his friends (and fellow war orphans) Yahiko and Konan, Nagato dreamed of bringing peace to the violent shinobi world. 
      However, following Yahiko's death, Nagato adopted the alias of Pain (ペイン, Pein) and, along with Konan, began leading a new Akatsuki — one that would force the world into peace using any means necessary.
      <br>
<b> My Opinion:</b>
Nagato had a very unique outlook on things. However he was a bad guy that you cared for. The way he used the Rinnegan was unique and impressive. 
The fact that he used chakra rods to reanimate Corpses and then give them individual abilities from the Rinnegan was one of my favorite things about the character. 
He was complex but relatable, deadly but beneath it you could see his pain, and most of all he was rememberable.

      <b> Sasori Info:</b>
      Sasori renowned as "Sasori of the Red Sand", Akasuna no Sasori), was an S-rank missing-nin from Sunagakure's Puppet Brigade 
      and a member of Akatsuki, where he was partnered with Orochimaru and later Deidara.
      <br>
<b> My Opinion:</b>
Sasori  unique in cool because of the way he used the puppet technique. This had already been shown in the anime prior to his introduction but was lackluster. 
However once you seen him utilize the same technique with the unique and Powerful spin on something that could have been perceived as boring originally. 
This made him extremely important to the plot in the ideal of what can be accomplished through creativity. his living puppets and the fact he made himself a puppet was something i enjoyed watching.

      <b> Itachi Uchiha Info:</b>
      Itachi Uchiha was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. 
      He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi. 
      Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.
      <br>
<b> My Opinion:</b>
Itachi Was one of the most complicated in loved characters of the anime. His unique struggle and decisions made him have moments in the anime were fans hated him and loved him. 
The love for his brother and the love for his village drove him to do some unspeakable things. However his power, his poise, and his technique was only rivaled because of his underlying illness. 
Meaning he may have been one of the most powerful members of his clan, which in itself is super impressive.
